#Project Ideas    
This project ideas list is just given as a suggestion. As written in the introduction, those ideas do however represent the short-term priorities of real users working in humanitarian NGOs. When describing a project idea, a User Priority is attributed to each feature request associated with it, to reflect its importance in the eyes of the users.

But user priority might not be GSoC volunteer priorityâ€¦ A new important feature requested urgently by some users may be felt as boring to develop by a GSoC volunteer. We just give those User priority because we believe that an exciting thing about contributing to Sigmah is that you're helping real users to work more efficiently in their daily work at managing humanitarian projects, and knowing where your help would be the most appreciated by users might be useful.

As a consequence, if a student wants to write its own proposal by mixing some of those projects or taking some inspiration from the roadmap, he's also welcomed to do so.        

###Project idea 1: A user-friendly reply to the need of flexible humanitarian projects       

**Presentation**    
Humanitarian projects are in some way like IT projects: they must be flexible. The needs of the populations for which they are conducted evolve in the time, some emergency or security situation may transform totally the feasibility of some of the planned activities. As a consequence, a project management system like Sigmah must let the possibility to let its users change their projects along they way, and keep tracks of those different versions. In the contractual world that link often humanitarian organisations with their public donors, those versions are usually linked with an Amendment. A first version of a amendment system has been set up in Sigmah version 1.0. But users have produce a lot of feedbacks on it to ask to change it deeply. Now, based on the experience they get with this first attempt to build a feature which is at the heart of Sigmah, we have a confirmed design of the feature they're expecting as a condition to fully adopt Sigmah in their whole organisations.

This complex and fundamental feature will be graphically designed by a UX Designer from Google working on the project through a French Red Cross - Google France partnership.      

**Examples**      
User Prority: 1

This project idea corresponds to feature request [0000167: Revise Amendments system behavior](http://www.sigmah.org/issues/view.php?id=167).

A preliminary mockup of the desired behavior is available at [this URL](www.sigmah.org/issues/file_download.php?file_id=74&type=bug). This mockup will be completely reviewed and can change totally in terms of graphic design with the help of the Google UX designer.

**Impact**
The current unsatisfying design of this feature makes it almost unused: with this new design which has been discussed a lot with users, Sigmah will be really able to provide to users the flexibility they need in their project, and the ease of use that produces a good versioning system.

**Knowledge prerequisite**
Java/GWT.
